    "title": "ADA Super Jet Filter ES900 (for W90cmxH45cm tank) with glass pipe set",
    "description": "ADA super jet filter ES-900 is a new addition to the lineup of the Super Jet Filter series. It provides stable and high filtration capacity over a long period of time. While maintaining the basic performance of the previous series, the ES-900 is optimized for the filtration system of a 90cm aquarium. \n\n\nADA super jet filter ES-900 is designed for maximum performance.  Powered by the highest quality Iwaki magnet drive pump, stable water flow is ensured even as the canister builds up debris over time and in between filter cleaning. The robust stainless steel construction is handcrafted by Japanese artisans.  It combines the highest quality production materials with a beautiful industrial design aesthetic. \n\n\nThe Super Jet Filter series lineup is now compatible with all ADA aquarium sizes with the introduction of the ES-900.\n\nUntil then, two ES-600 filters or ES-600EX (no longer available) were recommended for 90cm aquariums, but with the introduction of ES-900, the filtration system is optimized.  The full lineup of the Super Jet Filter series makes it easier to select a filter that best suits the size of the aquarium.\n\n\nMajor improvement features for ES-900\n\n\n1.) Adoption of the impeller with high flow rate specifications\nThe newly designed pump is tailor-made for ADA 90P aquarium (approx. 50 gallons) and produces strong and proper flow throughout the tank.\n\n\n2.) Bio Rio G is included as standard media\nAfter testing with various filter media, Bio Rio G has the lowest flow loss and is less likely to overload the pump.  The irregular grain shape has a rectifying effect and prevents uneven flow.\n\n\n3.) Optimized Lily Pipe\nAlong with the adoption of the new impeller specifications, the appropriate new pipe diameter for the pump has been matched. Lily Pipe P-4 (Ø13) is selected for the outflow pipe, and New Lily Pipe V-7 (Ø17), which is larger in diameter is selected for the inflow pipe.\n\n \n4.) Secrets of the slim canister\nA W90cm aquarium with a water volume of approximately 167 L (~50gallons) is in the category of large aquariums and requires a reasonable filtration capacity. The slim silhouette is the result of securing sufficient filtration capacity as well as being able to be stored in a cabinet.\n\n\n*This filter is designed with emphasis on power, low but audible noise can be heard\n\nNoise level: Less than 40dB (at 1m distance)\n\nA pair of glass pipes (Lily pipe P-4 13mm Outflow & V-7 17mm Inflow) for a 45cm tall aquarium is included. \n\nThe recommended size of the aquarium: ADA cube garden 90P (W90xD45xH45cm)\n\nMade in Japan",
